I present you a Java back-end , React front-end CRUD library app with Cucumber Crud tests.

This is an example application for the management and controll over rented and currently avaible books of a given library.
With this app a librarian can control the status of any book within the library and if rented, view the information of the renter.
With the help of our application , common users can choose a book to rent and give their additional information for the rent itself.
A librarian could add , remove or update the status or if a given book is even contained in the library itself.
